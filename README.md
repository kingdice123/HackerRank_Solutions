Some solutions for HackerRank's C++, Mathematics and Problem Solving modules


Feel free to send pull requests since I upload solutions as I do it and may not ever do all of them.

Send the code and a little explanation attached to it so everyone can see whats going on and preferably use variable names which kinda describe what they do, dont just use a,b,c :)
